# Estimating Taxi Fares in New York City

Overview

The goal of this project was to create a linear regression and A/B testing to predict taxi cab fares in New York City. The A/B testing was performed to analyze the relationship between credit card payments and total fare amount. At this point, this project's focus is to find ways to generate more revenue for NYC taxi cab drivers.

Business Understanding 

According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is also important to understand what factors encourage riders to pay via cards in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage. 

Data Understanding

The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data came from NYC.gov. The Automatidata data team considered trip distance and total amount as key variables to depict a taxi cab ride. 

Modelling and Evaluation 

The feature with the greatest effect on fare amount was ride duration, which was not unexpected. The model revealed a mean increase of $7 for each additional minute, however, this is not a reliable benchmark due to the high correlation between some features. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission can use these findings to create an app that allows users (TLC riders) to see the estimated fare before their ride begins.

Conclusion

The Automatidata data team can consult the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission to share the model results and recommend that the model be used as an indicator of tip amount with a very high degree of uncertainty. However, additional data is needed to realize significant improvement in the model.
